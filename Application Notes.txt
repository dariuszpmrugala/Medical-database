Reese's TODO:
	create base of app w/ main activity
	integrate camera
		access file storage for images or pdfs of health records
	create login activity
	create settings activity
	
	
Thoughts and notes
	will need a sort of user login
		keep logged in until manually log out
		link to .db access and online db access
		
	need to access user's files to get images or pdfs of health records
		can we turn pdf directly into an image?
			is this worth doing, or make the user screenshot it themself?
			probably better if we do it, otherwise we may get info from navigation bar
		will probably still need to do this to get most recent camera image file unless API returns it
